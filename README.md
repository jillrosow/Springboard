# Springboard
This repository contains many jupyter notebooks showcasing data wrangling, statistics, and predictive modeling skills I have learned through Springboards Data Science Career Track curriculum 

# JSON Mini Project 
Read in data from a json file, fine the top 10 countries with the most projects, find the top 10 major project themes, create a dataframe with the missing values filled in. 

# Clustering 
Used a dataframe with information on marketing newsletters/e-mail campaigns (e-mail offers sent to customers) and transaction level data from customers. Utilized pd.merge and pd.pivot_table for data wrangling. K-Means clustering is performed, with silhoutte plots to analyze. 

# Linear Regression 
Used linear regression to predict Boston housing prices. 

# Logistic Regression 
Used logistic regression to classify height and weight data into female or male classes.

# Naive Bayes 
Used naive bayes for text classification.

# Bayesian Inference

# API data wrangling 
Used Quandl API to pull data on the stock market is JSON format, and then wrangled and explored the data. 

# Inferential statistics 1a 
Testing normality with t tests. 

# Inferential statistics 1b
Central limit theorem and t testing. 

# Inferential statistics 2
Used bootstrapping techniques to make estimates about a population. 

# Inferential statistics 3 
Used Bayesian inference to estimate the likelihood of predictions. PyMc3 is used to model various distributions. 

# SQL project
Practice with advanced SQL queries
